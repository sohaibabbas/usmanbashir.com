# HOWTO: Fix Vagrant Not Recognizing Existing Machine

I’ve been using vagrant as a cornerstone of my development environment for a while now. This morning I booted up my machine, and tried to cd into my working directory only to be greeted with this:

`bash: cd: projects: No such file or directory`

After a few seconds contemplating whether panic or confusion (or both) was the proper response, I fell back to confusion. Everything is on github anyways, I just didn’t want to go through the cloning of my dotfiles and going through yet another bundle install.

I fired up VirtualBox GUI and found a new box. Apparently VirtualBox sometimes fails to report information about the machine; Vagrant did not recognize the original box and just imported my default base box. Maybe the system crashing last night was the culprit.

Here is how to fix a vagrant detachment.

`cd .vagrant/machines/default`

`cp id id.bak #back up just in case`

Grab the uuid of your original box using

`VBoxManage list vms`

Now replace whatever uuid exists in the id file with the copied uuid from the VBoxManage command. You should be up and running now.
